It could be a quick Math problem or a serious research paper in a mind-wrecking topic, but rest assured we always have an expert open to helping you out with any type of the assignment. Here’s how the custom homework writing process looks like.</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Analyzing order instructions.</strong> Every customer has their own prompt with individual instructions. Upload such file when making an order, and you writer will know how to proceed with your homework in the most effective fashion. All your requirements will be followed in and out.</li>
                                <li><strong>Brainstorming a topic.</strong> If you have a topic, we’ll proceed with it to conduct savvy topic research. Don’t have a topic? Your expert will think of an excellent topic based on order instructions and requested background sources. Then, a writer will research a topic thoroughly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Collecting requested background sources.</strong> Any high school and college writing assignment has to rely on reputable sources of information as evidence and argumentation of your key points. Before conducting any topic research, a writer will gather and analyze the background sources first.</li>
                                <li><strong>Thinking of a strong thesis statement.</strong> It doesn't matter whether we speak a short essay or a serious case study, there always has to be a powerful thesis statement. Your writer will write an engaging, attention-grabbing thesis statement your tutor will most definitely appreciate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Gathering quotes.</strong> How to prove your thesis statement is true? Add 4-6 quotes from reputable sources to your essay or term paper, and the audience will rest convinced that your argumentation is bulletproof. We’ll cite all in-text quotes by the textbook (APA/MLA/Chicago/OSCOLA.)</li>
                                <li><strong>Preparing the first draft.</strong> Just as all the preparatory work is over, the writing stage commences. Your writer will deliver fully authentic texts which could pass the Turnitin seamlessly. No plagiarism, no copy-and-paste, no cheating. Only original writing from professional homework specialists!</li>
                                <li><strong>Proofreading, formatting, and editing texts.</strong> An assignment could be called excellent only if there are no grammar, style, punctuation, and formatting mistakes. That’s why we’ll proofread and edit every line carefully to provide you with a 100% correct assignment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Making a ready assignment available for you to download.</strong> When an assigned time comes, feel free to have your homework downloaded from the Customer area. It could also be sent to your email. The service is aimed at your convenience and maximum customer satisfaction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Doing free revisions (on the customer’s demand.)</strong> Use 14-30 days of free revisions to make changes in the texts if you need any. We’re open to any revision requests to work on texts double-quick in order to make homework even more compelling.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <span>“I really like my homework help from your service!” The satisfaction rate among our customers is 96% and counting; 100s of satisfied customers take advantage of professional homework help on our website daily. And we don’t really see any reasons why they shouldn’t! The service is all about quality, timely delivery, and reasonable prices for professionally done homework.</span>
